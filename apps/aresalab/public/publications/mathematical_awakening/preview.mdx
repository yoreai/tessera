## Overview

To my girls — **Allyana, Emalina, and Milana** — I want you to grow up with the confidence that the world is knowable. Not “easy,” not “obvious,” but understandable if you’re willing to stay curious, ask good questions, and keep going when something feels hard. Mathematics is one of the clearest languages we have for that kind of understanding: it teaches you how to separate signal from noise, how to reason from first principles, and how to build truth step by step.

In the years ahead, intelligence — both human and machine — will shape nearly everything. My hope is that this book helps you see how intelligence is built: how patterns become models, how models become decisions, and how decisions can be made with humility and care. If you can learn to read the equations behind the world, you won’t just use the future — you’ll help create it.

Thank you to **my wife**, for believing in me, for holding our family together through the long stretches of work, and for reminding me what matters most. And thank you to **my mom**, for her steady love and support — for the sacrifices that made my education possible, and for the strength that taught me to finish what I start.

And thank you to **my dad**, for never once doubting me — for the quiet confidence that made me feel brave enough to try, and the steady presence that reminded me I could.

And to **my mom**, again — thank you for helping us **day and night** with the kids so I could do this work. Your love shows up in every page, even when your name isn’t on the cover.

If you’re reading this years from now: I love you. Always.
