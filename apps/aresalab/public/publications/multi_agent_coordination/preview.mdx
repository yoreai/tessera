## Abstract

Environmental risk assessment at scale requires synthesizing diverse expertise—wildfire behavior, flood hydrology, seismic hazards, infrastructure vulnerability—that no single model can encompass. This paper presents a **Multi-Agent Geospatial Coordination Protocol (MACP)** that distributes risk assessment across 128 specialized agents organized into domain-specific pools, achieving both high accuracy and robust fault tolerance.

Our theoretical contributions establish:

1. **Consensus Optimality**: We prove that our weighted consensus mechanism produces the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) of true risk when agent confidences reflect inverse variance (Theorem 1). This result, derived from the Gauss-Markov theorem, guarantees statistical optimality.

2. **Convergence Bounds**: We establish probabilistic bounds on consensus accuracy using Chebyshev's inequality, proving that with $n$ agents, the consensus error is bounded by $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ with high probability (Corollary 1).

3. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: We prove that MACP tolerates up to $\lfloor (n-1)/3 \rfloor$ Byzantine (arbitrarily faulty) agents while maintaining bounded consensus error (Theorem 3).

4. **Communication Complexity**: We analyze message and bandwidth complexity, showing that MACP achieves $O(n)$ messages and $O(n \cdot m)$ bandwidth per assessment round.

Experimental evaluation on California fire hazard data demonstrates that the 128-agent MACP achieves **89.7% classification accuracy**—6.3 percentage points better than single-model baselines—with **93% scaling efficiency** up to 256 agents. Real-world deployment processes 546,000+ addresses in under 35 seconds.

## Introduction

## The Challenge of Multi-Domain Risk Assessment

On October 9, 2017, multiple wildfires ignited simultaneously across Northern California wine country. Within hours, the Tubbs Fire alone had destroyed 5,636 structures in Santa Rosa. Post-incident analysis revealed that the fires exploited a convergence of factors: dry vegetation from prolonged drought, extreme Diablo winds channeled through Sonoma Valley's terrain, aging power infrastructure prone to ignition, and a road network that created fuel breaks in some areas while funneling evacuees through bottlenecks in others.

No single expert—not a fire behavior specialist, not a meteorologist, not an infrastructure engineer—possessed the comprehensive knowledge needed to predict which addresses faced the highest risk. The challenge was fundamentally one of coordination: how to synthesize diverse domain expertise into unified risk assessments at the speed required for effective emergency response.

This coordination challenge motivates our work on multi-agent systems for geospatial risk assessment. Rather than building a monolithic model that attempts to capture all relevant factors, we propose distributing expertise across specialized agents that collaborate through a principled consensus protocol.

## Multi-Agent Systems for Geospatial Intelligence

Multi-agent systems (MAS) have been studied extensively in distributed computing , robotics , and game theory . The fundamental insight is that complex problems can often be decomposed into subproblems handled by specialized agents, with coordination mechanisms combining their outputs.

For geospatial risk assessment, this decomposition is natural:

- **Wildfire agents** specialize in fire behavior, fuel conditions, weather patterns, and suppression logistics
- **Flood agents** understand hydrology, precipitation dynamics, drainage infrastructure, and coastal hazards
- **Seismic agents** assess fault proximity, ground motion, liquefaction potential, and structural vulnerability
- **Analytics agents** integrate multi-hazard assessments and quantify compound risks

Each agent type can be trained on domain-specific data, consult domain-specific data sources, and apply domain-specific reasoning. The coordination protocol then synthesizes their assessments into unified risk scores.

## Challenges in Multi-Agent Coordination

Effective multi-agent coordination must address several challenges:

**Heterogeneous Expertise.** Agents have different competencies and should have different influence on the final assessment. A wildfire specialist's opinion on fire risk should carry more weight than a flood specialist's.

**Varying Confidence.** Even within their domain, agents may be more or less confident depending on the specific situation. An agent should be able to express uncertainty.

**Potential Failures.** In production systems, agents may fail (software bugs, data unavailability) or even produce adversarial outputs (security compromises). The system must remain reliable despite individual agent failures.

**Scalability.** Processing hundreds of thousands of addresses requires efficient communication patterns that don't bottleneck on coordination overhead.

**Correctness.** The consensus mechanism should have provable properties: it should converge, produce statistically optimal estimates, and degrade gracefully under failures.

## Our Contributions

This paper presents the Multi-Agent Geospatial Coordination Protocol (MACP), a theoretically grounded approach to distributed risk assessment. Our contributions are:

**1. Agent Architecture.** We define a 128-agent system organized into four domain-specific pools (Wildfire, Flood, Seismic, Analytics), each containing 32 specialized agents with distinct sub-competencies.

**2. Weighted Consensus Protocol.** We develop a confidence-weighted consensus mechanism and prove:

- *Optimality* (Theorem 1): Weighted consensus is the BLUE estimator
- *Convergence* (Corollary 1): Consensus error bounded by $O(1/\sqrt{n})$
- *Fault Tolerance* (Theorem 3): Byzantine tolerance up to $n/3$ failures

**3. Communication Efficiency.** We analyze message complexity and design efficient communication patterns achieving $O(n)$ messages per assessment.

**4. Empirical Validation.** We demonstrate on California fire hazard data:

- 89.7% accuracy with 6.3 pp improvement over single-model baselines
- 93% scaling efficiency up to 256 agents
- Full dataset processing (546K addresses) in under 35 seconds

**5. Real-World Deployment.** We describe operational deployment for BlazeBuilder, including lessons learned from production use.
