## Abstract

This study demonstrates data engineering techniques for manufacturing process analytics through multi-source data integration, exploratory analysis, and clustering methods. We analyzed operational data from three manufacturing machines alongside supplier information to identify relationships between machine performance, operating conditions, and supplier characteristics.

The dataset comprised sensor readings from Machine 01 (15,000 observations), Machine 02 (12,000 observations), and Machine 03 (18,000 observations), capturing temperature, speed, torque, and tool wear metrics. By merging these machine datasets with supplier data, we created an integrated view enabling analysis of how supplier-provided components influence machine performance and operational patterns.

Our analysis revealed distinct operational profiles for each machine, with Machine 01 showing highest variability in operating conditions, Machine 02 demonstrating most consistent performance, and Machine 03 operating at elevated temperatures suggesting potential maintenance needs. K-means clustering identified five operational regimes characterized by different combinations of temperature, speed, and tool wear, with clear associations to specific suppliers.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduced the high-dimensional sensor data to two principal components explaining 73% of variance, enabling visualization of operational patterns and identification of outlier conditions. Supplier analysis revealed that certain suppliers' components correlate with more stable operating conditions, suggesting quality differences in supplied parts.

This research showcases essential data science skills including multi-source data merging, handling missing values, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised learning for pattern discovery in manufacturing contexts.

## Introduction

Manufacturing operations generate massive volumes of sensor and operational data from machines, production lines, and supply chains. Extracting actionable insights from these diverse data sources requires systematic data engineering, integration, and analytical techniques. This project demonstrates core data science capabilities through analysis of a simulated manufacturing dataset.

## Problem Context

Modern manufacturing environments face several analytical challenges:

- **Multi-Source Integration**: Data resides in separate systems (machine sensors, supplier databases, quality logs) requiring merging and reconciliation
- **High Dimensionality**: Sensor data captures numerous variables creating complex, correlated feature spaces
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying normal vs. abnormal operating conditions from continuous sensor streams
- **Supply Chain Insights**: Understanding how upstream suppliers influence downstream machine performance

## Research Objectives

This study pursues three analytical goals:

1. **Data Integration**: Successfully merge machine sensor data with supplier information to create unified analytical dataset
2. **Operational Pattern Discovery**: Use clustering and dimensionality reduction to identify distinct operational regimes
3. **Supplier Performance Analysis**: Assess whether supplier characteristics correlate with machine performance metrics

## Analytical Approach

We employed a systematic workflow typical of manufacturing analytics projects:

**Data Preparation** → Merging five separate CSV files, handling missing values, standardizing variables

**Exploratory Analysis** → Examining distributions, correlations, and supplier patterns through visualization

**Dimensionality Reduction** → Applying PCA to compress sensor data while retaining variance

**Clustering Analysis** → Using K-means to identify operational regimes and supplier associations

**Interpretation** → Connecting analytical findings to operational and supply chain implications

This project showcases practical data engineering and machine learning skills applicable across manufacturing, industrial IoT, and supply chain analytics contexts.
