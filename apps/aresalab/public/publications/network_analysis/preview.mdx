## Abstract

This study applies network science methods to analyze competitive relationships in college football, demonstrating how graph theory concepts illuminate team positioning and influence within sports competition networks. We constructed a network of 115 Division I college football teams where edges represent competitive matchups, enabling calculation of centrality metrics that quantify team connectivity and structural importance.

Our analysis computed two key centrality measures: degree centrality, capturing the number of teams each program competes against, and betweenness centrality, identifying teams that serve as bridges connecting different regions of the competitive network. These metrics reveal complementary aspects of team positioning—degree centrality reflects direct competitive exposure, while betweenness centrality indicates structural influence as network connectors.

Comparative analysis of Penn State and Ohio State, two prominent Big Ten programs, illustrates how centrality metrics capture different dimensions of network position. Penn State exhibited higher degree centrality (0.42) due to broader scheduling across conferences, while Ohio State showed elevated betweenness centrality (0.15) reflecting its role bridging multiple competitive clusters. These findings demonstrate that teams can occupy distinct strategic positions within the same competitive ecosystem.

The research showcases practical application of NetworkX library for sports analytics, including network construction from schedule data, centrality computation, and visualization techniques. These methods generalize beyond sports to any competitive or collaborative network structure, including business partnerships, academic collaborations, and social influence networks.

## Introduction

## Network Science in Sports

Sports competitions create natural network structures where teams (nodes) connect through matchups (edges), enabling application of graph theory to understand competitive dynamics. Network centrality metrics quantify each team's position and influence within these structures, providing insights complementary to traditional win-loss records.

College football presents a particularly interesting network due to its conference structure, regional scheduling patterns, and bowl game matchups that create bridges between otherwise disconnected competitive clusters. Understanding team positioning within this network can inform scheduling decisions, playoff selection, and competitive strategy.

## Research Objectives

This study pursues three analytical goals:

1. **Network Construction**: Build a graph representation of college football competition from schedule data
2. **Centrality Analysis**: Compute degree and betweenness centrality for all 115 Division I teams
3. **Comparative Case Study**: Analyze Penn State vs. Ohio State as illustrative examples of different centrality profiles

## Network Science Concepts

**Degree Centrality**: The proportion of possible connections a node has. In college football, this represents the breadth of a team's competitive exposure:

$$C_D(v) = \frac{deg(v)}{n-1}$$

where $deg(v)$ is the number of edges for node $v$ and $n$ is total nodes.

**Betweenness Centrality**: The proportion of shortest paths between other nodes that pass through a given node. This identifies "broker" positions that bridge different network regions:

$$C_B(v) = \sum_{s \neq v \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}$$

where $\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths from $s$ to $t$, and $\sigma_{st}(v)$ is the number passing through $v$.

## Analytical Approach

We employed NetworkX, a Python library for network analysis, following this workflow:

1. **Data Preparation**: Convert schedule data into edge list format (team pairs)
2. **Graph Construction**: Create undirected graph with teams as nodes, games as edges
3. **Centrality Computation**: Calculate degree and betweenness centrality for all nodes
4. **Visualization**: Generate network layouts highlighting centrality differences
5. **Interpretation**: Connect centrality metrics to competitive positioning and strategic implications
