                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>This study applies network science methods to analyze competitive relationships in college football, demonstrating how graph theory concepts illuminate team positioning and influence within sports competition networks. We constructed a network of 115 Division I college football teams where edges represent competitive matchups, enabling calculation of centrality metrics that quantify team connectivity and structural importance.</p>

                <p>Our analysis computed two key centrality measures: degree centrality, capturing the number of teams each program competes against, and betweenness centrality, identifying teams that serve as bridges connecting different regions of the competitive network.</p>

                <p><strong>Comparative Case Study:</strong> Penn State exhibited higher degree centrality (0.421) due to broader scheduling across conferences, while Ohio State showed elevated betweenness centrality (0.15) reflecting its role bridging multiple competitive clusters. These findings demonstrate that teams can occupy distinct strategic positions within the same competitive ecosystem.</p>

                        <h3>🔵 Degree Centrality</h3>
                        <p>Only 12 teams (10.4%) exceed median degree centrality. Notre Dame leads (0.526) with independent scheduling flexibility.</p>

                        <p>57 teams (49.6%) exceed median betweenness. Structural importance more widely distributed than simple connectivity.</p>

                <ul class="method-list">
                    <li><strong>Network Construction</strong> - Built graph with 115 teams (nodes) and 613 games (edges) using NetworkX</li>
                    <li><strong>Centrality Computation</strong> - Calculated degree and betweenness centrality for all nodes</li>
                    <li><strong>Subgraph Analysis</strong> - Created above-median centrality subgraphs (12 vs 57 teams) to visualize distribution differences</li>
                    <li><strong>Comparative Case Study</strong> - Penn State vs Ohio State as illustrative examples of complementary network positions</li>
                </ul>
