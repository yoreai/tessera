# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Geographic Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) has emerged as a critical technology for environmental risk assessment, yet existing approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with the complex, multi-layered nature of spatial intelligence. This paper introduces **GeoAI Agentic Flow**, a novel architecture that synthesizes coordinate embedding, spatial neural networks, and multi-agent collaboration to achieve state-of-the-art performance in fire hazard risk assessment.

Our contributions are threefold:

1. **Coordinate Embedding Framework (CEF)**: We present a theoretically grounded embedding scheme that transforms raw geographic coordinates into semantically rich 512-dimensional vectors. We prove that CEF satisfies the bi-Lipschitz property, guaranteeing that spatial distances are preserved with bounded distortion in the embedding space.

2. **Spatial Neural Network (SNN)**: We introduce a graph-based architecture that processes embedded coordinates through multi-head attention mechanisms, capturing both local spatial relationships and global geographic patterns.

3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol (MACP)**: We formalize a 128-agent system organized into specialized pools, proving convergence guarantees for our weighted consensus mechanism and establishing fault tolerance bounds.

Rigorous evaluation on California fire hazard data (546,000+ addresses, 1,955 fire hazard zones) demonstrates that GeoAI Agentic Flow achieves **89.7% risk classification accuracy** with **sub-100ms inference latency** at scale---a 40% improvement in throughput over traditional GIS pipelines while maintaining geospatial accuracy within **15 meters**.

These results establish GeoAI Agentic Flow as a principled foundation for real-time environmental intelligence, with immediate applications in wildfire response, flood prediction, and climate adaptation planning.
